Once I was introduced to GRPC and Thrift, there is no going back to the transitional JSON REST APIs, let alone the even worse XML-base SOAP APIs. 

Every one says Rust has a steep learning curve. But yet, it remains the most loved programming language 3 years in a row based on stackoverflow survay. 

One thing might be because the community that are passionate about Rust are from C, C++ world? If that's the case, Rust is not harder to learn in comparison. 


[Make sure your Rust is up to date](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51687419/1035008):

```
$ rustup update stable
```

And check the current version of rust and cargo:

```
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.60.0 (7737e0b5c 2022-04-04)
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.60.0 (d1fd9fe2c 2022-03-01)
```

We also need `cmake` to compile `prost-build`. Let's [install that view brew](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33628202/1035008).

```
$ brew install cmake
```

Let's double check to make sure the cmake is installed properly:

```
$ cmake --version
cmake version 3.23.1
```

# Testing The GRPC Server
```
brew install --cask bloomrpc
```

```
cargo run --bin client
```
