## Background

### RPC vs JSON vs SOAP

Once I learned about [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [Thrift](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift), it is hard to go back to using the more transitional JSON-based REST API or [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) API.

There are two well-known RPC framework -- gRPC and Thrift, and they have many similarities. The former originates from Google while the latter originates from Facebook. Both of them are easy to use, have great supports for a wide range of programming languages, and are both are performant.

The most valuable feature is code generation in multiple languages and also server side reflection. These make the API essentially type-safe. With server side reflection, it makes it much easier to explore the schema definition of the API without having to read and understand the implementation.

### Grpc vs Thrift

[Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) historically has been a popular choice. However, in recent years, due to a lack of continuous support from Facebook, and fragmentation with the fork of [fbthrift](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift), it slowly loose popularity.

In the meantime, gRPC has caught up with more and more features with healthier ecosystem.

As of today, unless your application is affiliated with Facebook in someway, there is no good reason to consider Thrift.

### How about GraphQL?

[GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec) is another framework initiated from Facebook. It shares many similarities with the two RPC frameworks above.

One of the biggest pain points in mobile API development is that users never upgrade their app. Because we want to maintain backward compatibility, we either have to keep old unused fields in the API and create multiple version of the API. GraphQL is invented to solve that problem. It is designed to a "query language" and allow the client to specify what data fields that it needs. This makes it easier to handle backward compatibility.

GraphQL has its value in developing mobile APIs and public facing APIs (such as [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)). Since, in both cases, we could not easily control the client behaviour.

However, if we have building API for web frontend or API for internal backend services, I see no obvious benefit of choose GraphQL over gRPC.

## Rust

That's a small overview of the networking frameworks above so far. Beside networking, we also need to decide on a language for application server.

Rust remains the most loved programming language based on Stack Overflow survey since year of 2016. Its type-safety, elegant memory management, and wide community support, performance, all make Rust a very attractive and promising programming language for backend service developments despite the relatively steeper learning curve.

Based on [StackOverflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-language-love-dread):

> For the sixth-year, Rust is the most loved language.

![](/assets/images/rust-most-loved-2021.png)

We also to start seeing wider and wider adoption of Rust in the industry: [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/04/29/developer-tools/rust/), [Dropbox](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/), [Yelp](https://youtu.be/u6ZbF4apABk), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/sustainability-with-rust/), [Google](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/02/google-joins-rust-foundation.html), etc.

It is clear that Rust will continue to grow and is here to stay.

That's what we'll look in in today's tutorial -- building a small client & server with Grpc in Rust.

## Install Rust

Install Rust with the following:

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you've previously installed Rust, we can update it via:

```
$ rustup update stable
```

Also see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for more details.

Let's double check the installed version of `rustc` (the Rust compiler) and `cargo` (the Rust package manager):

```
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.60.0 (7737e0b5c 2022-04-04)
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.60.0 (d1fd9fe2c 2022-03-01)
```

## Create a Rust Project

This will create a new "Hello World" project:

```
cargo new rust_grpc_demo --bin
```

Let's compile and run the program:

```
$ cd rust_grpc_demo

$ cargo build
  Compiling rust_grpc_demo v0.1.0 (/Users/yuchen21/Desktop/rust_grpc_demo)
   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.70s

$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/rust_grpc_demo`
Hello, world!
```

This is the file structures so far:

```
$ find . -not -path "./target*" -not -path "./.git*" | sed -e "s/[^-][^\/]*\//  |/g" -e "s/|\([^ ]\)/|-\1/"

|-Cargo.toml
|-Cargo.lock
|-src
|  |-main.rs
```

## Define Grpc Interface

gRPC uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) for serializing an deserializing data.

Let's define the server API in a `.proto` file.

```
mkdir proto
touch proto/greater_service.proto
```

In this file:

```
syntax = "proto3";

package greeter;

// The greeter service definition.
service GreeterService {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc Great (GreeterRequest) returns (GreeterResponse) {}
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message GreeterRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings
message GreeterResponse {
  string message = 1;
}
```

We will create our GRPC service with [tonic](https://docs.rs/tonic/latest/tonic/).

Add the following dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[dependencies]
tonic = "0.7.1"
tokio = { version = "1.18.0", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
prost = "0.10.1"

[build-dependencies]
tonic-build = "0.10.3"
```

To generate Rust code from `greater_service.proto`, we use `tonic-build` in the crateâ€™s `build.rs` build-script.

```
touch build.rs
```

Add the following to the `build.rs` file:

```
fn main() {
    let proto_file = "./proto/hello.proto";

    tonic_build::configure()
        .build_server(true)
        .compile(&[proto_file], &["."])
        .unwrap_or_else(|e| panic!("protobuf compile error: {}", e));

        println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed={}", proto_file);
}
```

`tonic-build` depends on the Protocol Buffers compiler, to parse `.proto` files into a representation that can be transformed into Rust.

Let's install `protobuf`:

```
$ brew install protobuf
```

And double check that the protobuf compiler is installed properly:

```
$ protoc --version

libprotoc 3.19.4
```

Now run `cargo build` to build the `.proto` now:

```
$ cargo build
   Compiling rust_grpc_demo v0.1.0 (/Users/yuchen21/Desktop/rust_grpc_demo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.38s
```

## Implement the Server

Finally, time to put the service together. Replace the `main.rs` with the following:

```
pub mod greeter {
    tonic::include_proto!("greeter");
}


use tonic::{transport::Server, Request, Response, Status};

use greeter::{GreeterRequest, GreeterResponse};
use greeter::greeter_service_server::{GreeterService, GreeterServiceServer};

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct GreeterServiceImpl {}

#[tonic::async_trait]
impl GreeterService for GreeterServiceImpl {
    async fn greet(
        &self,
        request: Request<GreeterRequest>,
    ) -> Result<Response<GreeterResponse>, Status> {
        println!("Got a request from {:?}", request.remote_addr());

        let reply = GreeterResponse {
            message: format!("Hello {}!", request.into_inner().name),
        };
        Ok(Response::new(reply))
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let addr = "[::1]:50051".parse().unwrap();
    let greeter = GreeterServiceImpl::default();

    println!("GreeterServer listening on {}", addr);

    Server::builder()
        .add_service(GreeterServiceServer::new(greeter))
        .serve(addr)
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

And to run the server:

```
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.65s
     Running `target/debug/rust_grpc_demo`
GreeterServer listening on [::1]:50051
```

Nice we have our GRPC server in Rust up and running!

## Server reflection

As stated at the beginning, I was first impressed by GRPC because its capability of doing server reflection.
Not only is it handy during service development, it also make communication with frontend engineers a lot easier.

So, it wouldn't be complete to conclude this tutorial without explaining how to add that for the Rust Server.

Add the following to the dependencies:

```
tonic-reflection = "0.4.0"
```

Update `builld.rs` to the following:

```
use std::{env, path::PathBuf};

fn main() {
    let out_dir = PathBuf::from(env::var("OUT_DIR").unwrap());

    tonic_build::configure()
        .build_server(true)
        .file_descriptor_set_path(out_dir.join("greeter_descriptor.bin"))
        .compile(protos=&["./proto/greeter_service.proto"], &["."])
        .unwrap_or_else(|e| panic!("protobuf compile error: {}", e));

        println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed={}", proto_file);
}
```

And finally, update the `main.rs` to the following. The lines that need to be changed are marked with `Add this` comment.

```
use tonic::{transport::Server, Request, Response, Status};

use greeter::{GreeterRequest, GreeterResponse};
use greeter::greeter_service_server::{GreeterService, GreeterServiceServer};


mod greeter {
    tonic::include_proto!("greeter");

    // Add this
    pub(crate) const FILE_DESCRIPTOR_SET: &[u8] =
        tonic::include_file_descriptor_set!("greeter_descriptor");
}


#[derive(Default)]
pub struct GreeterServiceImpl {}

#[tonic::async_trait]
impl GreeterService for GreeterServiceImpl {
    async fn greet(
        &self,
        request: Request<GreeterRequest>,
    ) -> Result<Response<GreeterResponse>, Status> {
        println!("Got a request from {:?}", request.remote_addr());

        let reply = GreeterResponse {
            message: format!("Hello {}!", request.into_inner().name),
        };
        Ok(Response::new(reply))
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let addr = "[::1]:50051".parse().unwrap();
    let greeter = GreeterServiceImpl::default();

    // Add this
    let service = tonic_reflection::server::Builder::configure()
        .register_encoded_file_descriptor_set(greeter::FILE_DESCRIPTOR_SET)
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    println!("GreeterServer listening on {}", addr);

    Server::builder()
        .add_service(GreeterServiceServer::new(greeter))
        .add_service(service) // Add this
        .serve(addr)
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

# Testing The GRPC Server

There are many GUI client to play with GRPC Server, such as Postman, [bloomrpc](https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc), .... To keep things simple for today, we will use the default `grpc_cli`.

```
$ brew install grpc
```

```
brew install --cask bloomrpc
```

```
grpc_cli call localhost:50051 greeter.GreeterService.Greet "name: 'world'"
connecting to localhost:50051
Received initial metadata from server:
date : Sun, 08 May 2022 13:57:47 GMT
message: "Hello world!"
Rpc succeeded with OK status
```

And with that, we

That's it for today. Thanks for reading and happy coding!
